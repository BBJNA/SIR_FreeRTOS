# SIR_FreeRTOS
This is for the Subsurface Imaging Robot project for a Wentworth Institute of Technology Electromechanical Engineering Project.
As of 10/29/2017 this code is a potential baseline for the project. We are unsure if we want to go with a FreeRTOS applicaiton right now. We developing this code to become familiar with FreeRTOS. The hardware used for this is an Arduino Due that we are programming with Atmel Studio and Bossac.
